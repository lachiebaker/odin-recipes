                    <li>3 cups vegetable broth</li>
                    <li>1 cup red lentils, soaked</li>
                    <li>&frac14; walnuts</li>
                    <li>1 can of crushed tomatoes or whole peeled tomatoes</li>
                    <li>Lots of pasta</li>
                    <li>1 tablespoon of high-quality balsamic vinegar</li>
                    <li>Flat-leaf Italian parley or fresh basil</li>
                    <li>Lots of parmesan to taste</li>
                </ul>
            <h2>Steps</h2>
                <ol>
                    <li>Soak the 1 cup of lentils in water for 30 minutes, or up to 60 minutes. Meanwhile prep all the other ingredients.</li>
                    <li>Heat a 12-inch deep saute pan on medium-high heat. Add the olive oil, and once it's simmering, add the onions and season with a pinch of salt.</li>
                    <li>Stir occasionally and cook the onions until a light brown fond starts to form on the surface of the pan, about 5 minutes. Add a few spoons of water to deglaze the pan, and stir.</li>
                    <li>Add the garlic, thyme, oregano, 1 &frac12; teaspoons salt, and pepper to taste. Stir frequently and cook for 60-90 seconds</li>
                    <li>Optional: If using red wine, pour the wine into the pan and deglaze, scraping up and browned bits. Cook for 1-2 minutes, until the smell of alcohol has burned off and the mixture is jammy.</li>
                    <li>Pour in the broth to deglaze the pan, stirring any browned bits on the bottom of the pot and stirring the broth into the tomato paste to combine.</li>
                    <li>Add the lentils and walnuts, and stir to incorporate. Heat until the mixture comes to a boil, then reduce the heat to medium-low to maintain a rapid simmer ofr 20 minutes, stirring occasionally.</li>
                    <li>Add the crushed tomatoes and simmer for another 15-20 minutes, or until the lentils are tender but still al dente, stirring occasionally to prevent burning and sticking</li>
                    <li>Meanwhile, bring a large pot of water to the boil and salt. Add the pasta and cook until al dente.</li>
                    <li>Add the hot cooked pasta to the bolognese and toss until evenly coated in the sauce, adding a bit of pasta water as needed to ensure the sauce coats the noodles.</li>
